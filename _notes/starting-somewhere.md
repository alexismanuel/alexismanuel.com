This is the first note I'm writing on this website. Quite fitting, as the subject is "starting somewhere".

I truly believe it is the first step towards an amazing journey of publicly building myself. I am already grateful for all the amazing stories to come.

I think it will be a good thing to illustrate each note with a closing quote related to the discussed subject.

Related to starting points is the idea that it takes root within a deep desire to achieve and thus before anything else. [Napoleon Hill famously said "Desire is the starting point of all achievement, not a hope, not a wish, but a keen pulsating desire which transcends everything."](/notes/desire-is-the-starting-point){: .internal-link}.
