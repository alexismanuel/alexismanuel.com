The same is valid in other disciplines: as a software developer, I keep facing roadblocks every day even though I spend most of my waking hours on software-related activities. I don't face less bugs than before, but I have better techniques to debug them, and what those techniques I'm able to fix them faster.

As it gets harder and harder, I become better at problem solving thanks to my unsatisified desire to keep going. I do not wish or hope to get better, I just embrace hardships to get out it sharper.
